# wordstar-linux-spine
Wordstar Linux's Manjaro Linux Frontend and group of scripts that integrates Sublime Text 3 Install, 
Sublime Text's frontend with wordsmith / pandoc ebook/pdf generation.
Possibly some other crap not mentioned, too!

**Requires Python3 and tk (tcl/tk.)**

extract to dir in your $PATH, then run Spine.py

These set of scripts can be easily modified to work on any distro and/or desktop enviroment (or even lack thereof.)
Perhaps the goal will be to set it up as such, as these will probably only work under **Manjaro Linux 19.02**, or even Arch varients.

These were modified from scripts I've made over the years, and thought I'd share with the world. I've have them working between
various flavors of Linux concurrently (e.g. funtoo, mx linux, fedora VM) but gutted some of the references (i.e. funtoos chroot32 shit, some rvm checks) to clean up for debugging
a community roll derived from Manjaro Gnome 3. Enjoy.
